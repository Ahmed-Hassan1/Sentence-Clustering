# sentence-clustering

The vectoring is based on sentence-transformers libraries.

Include a csv file that has one column that contains all the sentences, and modify what is explained in the comments inside the code.

The two files are for K-mean clustering that has a predetermined number of clusters, and the other is Agglomerative clustering with no prior indication of the number of clusters.
